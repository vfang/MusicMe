If you pulled an older version of the repo, you probably have a bunch of .pyc files in playlist/* and MusicMe/*. 
These are precompiled python files, I added them to the .gitignore but you may already be "tracking" them on your
local machine, which means git will try to add these files to the repo again when you commit, even though they should
be ignored. To solve this, run

git rm <file>.pyc --cached 

for all the pyc files. This will keep the files on your local machine but tell git not to track them.
